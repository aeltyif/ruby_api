# Ruby Restful API
This is my solution for a code challenge, creating restful API using ruby on rails
Job Dashboard, where you have admin to submit job posts, and job seekers to apply to those jobs

# Deployment
- Heroku was used, and it's link is : https://still-hamlet-26338.herokuapp.com/

# Todo
- Create spec files for testing (User, Applicant)
- Modify Job spec file, to authenticate before POST
